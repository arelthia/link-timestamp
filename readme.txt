== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it work with an embeded Vimeo video?=

Yes

= Will it work with an embeded Youtube video?=

Yes it works with a Youtube embeded video using just the url or using [embed].  It will not work with the old Youtube embed that uses the <iframe> code.

= Can I usethe shortcodes and automatically linked timestamps? =

You can use the shortcode and have automatically link timestamps enabled. However, they will not both work on the same content. If you have the shortcode on a post/page links will not be linked automatically for that post/page.
