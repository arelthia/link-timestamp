### Automatically link timestamps
* Link Timestamp can be configured to automatically link timestamps.
* Control which post type gets automatically linked from the settings page. (Settings > Link Timestamp)
* Control if timestamps are linked to audio or video. (Settings > Link Timestamp) This comes in handy if you have audio and video on the same page.
* Turn off auto linking on individual pages from the post editor.
